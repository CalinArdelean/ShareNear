This project was bootstrapped with React. To run it please open the terminal and cd into my-app directory. 
To ensure your machine has the required modules necessary to run the app, please type npm install, and 
once this is done type npm start.
Now that the app is running, if it is not automatically loaded you can open [http://localhost:3000] to view it in the browser.

Home page:
The app begins on a home page which lists items that have been posted up for rent (currently hardcoded). There is a navigaton
bar at the top, and clicking on our app's logo takes you back to this home page. There is also a search bar with allows users
to input names of products or a location filter to narrow down the list of items (currently the search button doesn't filter) 
the items as we will need to filter our item dataset according to what is being searched. The navbar also has a login button
which takes the user to a login page, or if a user is already logged in it will have a view profile button and a logout button, 
which takes the user to their profile page, or to the home page logged out respectively.
The user can see all the item listings on the home page and click to see each item to learn more about it and decide if they 
want to rent it.

Login Page:
If the user reaches the login page, they can input their username and password to login and be taken back to the home page.
Currently the credentials to login are username: user and password: user for a regular user account, or username: admin and
password: admin for an admin account, so please login with one of these if for the login to work. There is also a button on
this page to take a new user to a sign up page.

Sign up page:
A new user can input all their information in this page and then sign up. Currently the sign up page works without authenticating
the information the user has typed, so this will be fixed for phase 2.

View Profile Page:
A user gets through this page by accessing the button on the top right of the Navbar after logging in.
On this page a user can view their profile information and create a new listing to post on the site.

Rent Form Page:
This is the page that loads when the user is creating a new listing. They can input the information of the item they want to
rent, and then 

Admin views:
If a user logs in as an admin then they will have access to
