Description + Benefit:
ShareNear is a web application service that allows its users to create profiles, and put up listings of items
that they want to rent out to other users. They can also browse items that other users have put up for 
rent and choose to rent those items as well. It has great user benefit because it provides a platform 
that appeals to all ages, and is for anyone who would like to start making extra money by renting stuff
that would otherwise be collecting dust in their homes. It also appeals to users who are looking to
make use of items for a specific purpose or time period, and thus have no reason to actually purchase
such items they want to rent out.
